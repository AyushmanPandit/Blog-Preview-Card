## My process

-   Reviewed the designs and the style guide to plan my process
-   Wrote the html file for the page using semantic tags and gave them appropriate classes as per requirement
-   Styled the page using css in a stylesheet one element at a time until satisfied

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my first front end project and I had a lot of fun doing it. I learned how to center divs, style stuff accordingly to make them look clean and professional. I also learned how to use figma as a developer.

### Continued development

I wish to tackle further projects so that I can get more comfortable with stuff like Flexbox and Grid, then later learn JavaScript to make better websites.
